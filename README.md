📝 Objective

Build an offline chat-reply recommendation system that predicts the next possible reply from User A when User B sends a message — using User A’s previous conversation history as context.

📂 Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a Transformer-based language model (GPT-2) to understand two-person conversational data and generate context-aware replies.

It simulates a real-world conversational AI system where responses are generated offline, using pretrained language understanding.

⚙️ Key Features

✅ Efficient preprocessing and tokenization of long chat data
✅ Transformer fine-tuning using GPT-2
✅ Coherent and context-aware reply generation
✅ Model evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and Perplexity metrics
✅ Ready for offline deployment

🧠 Model Architecture

The model is based on GPT-2, a generative Transformer trained on conversational context.

Model Flow:

Input: “Context + UserB Message”

Model: Fine-tuned GPT-2 Transformer

Output: “UserA Reply Prediction”

🔍 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
BLEU	Measures text similarity between generated and reference replies
ROUGE-1 / ROUGE-L	Measures overlap of words and sequences
Perplexity	Measures model confidence in generating correct replies
